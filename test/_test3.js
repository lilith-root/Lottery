// Sure, here's an example of a basic fuzz testing script for the Lottery smart contract:

const ethers = require('ethers');

// Set up an Ethereum provider and contract instance
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();
const contractAddress = 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';
const abi = [
  // CONTRACT ABI HERE
];
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);

// Define the fuzzing function
async function fuzz() {
  // Generate a random player address and investment amount
  const player = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address;
  const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther((Math.random() * 10).toString());

  // Call the contract's invest function with the random inputs
  await contract.connect(provider.getSigner(player)).invest({
    value: amount
  });
}

// Run the fuzzing function in a loop
while (true) {
  await fuzz();
}

/*
This script generates random player addresses and investment amounts, and repeatedly calls the contract's invest function with these inputs. 
The goal is to see if any unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities arise when the contract is subjected to a large number of random inputs. 
Note that this script should be run with caution, as it can consume significant amounts of gas and Ether if left running for an extended period of time. 
It's also important to ensure that the contract's invest function has appropriate limits and safeguards in place to prevent abuse from malicious users.
