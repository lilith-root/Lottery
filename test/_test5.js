// Sure, here is an example integration test suite for the Lottery smart contract using JavaScript, Mocha testing framework, and Web3.js library:

const assert = require('chai').assert;
const Web3 = require('web3');
const LotteryContract = artifacts.require('Lottery');

contract('Lottery Integration Tests', async (accounts) => {
  let web3, lottery, admin, player1, player2;

  before(async () => {
    // Initialize web3 provider and get contract instance
    web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));
    lottery = await LotteryContract.deployed();

    // Set admin and players for testing
    admin = accounts[0];
    player1 = accounts[1];
    player2 = accounts[2];
  });

  it('should allow players to join the lottery and admin to select a winner', async () => {
    // Player 1 joins the lottery
    await lottery.invest({ from: player1, value: web3.utils.toWei('3', 'ether') });
    let player1Balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(player1);

    // Player 2 joins the lottery
    await lottery.invest({ from: player2, value: web3.utils.toWei('3', 'ether') });
    let player2Balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(player2);

    // Get the current contract balance
    let initialContractBalance = await web3.eth.getBalance(lottery.address);

    // Admin selects a winner
    await lottery.selectWinner({ from: admin });

    // Check the winner balance and reset players array
    let winner = await web3.eth.getBalance(player1) > player1Balance ? player1 : player2;
    let winnerBalance = await web3.eth.getBalance(winner);
    let contractBalance = await web3.eth.getBalance(lottery.address);

    assert.equal(contractBalance, 0, 'Contract balance should be zero after selecting a winner');
    assert.isAbove(winnerBalance, player1Balance, 'Winner balance should be higher than initial balance');
    assert.isAbove(winnerBalance, player2Balance, 'Winner balance should be higher than initial balance');
  });
});

/*
This test suite covers the basic functionality of the Lottery smart contract and tests for the integration between the contract and the Ethereum network. 
It ensures that players can join the lottery, the admin can select a winner, and the winner receives the correct amount of Ether.
