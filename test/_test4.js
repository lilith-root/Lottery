// Sure, here's an example of unit tests for the Lottery smart contract using the Truffle testing framework and Solidity's built-in testing library:
// Import the required modules

const Lottery = artifacts.require('Lottery');

contract('Lottery', (accounts) => {
  let lottery;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Deploy a new instance of the Lottery contract before each test
    lottery = await Lottery.new({ from: accounts[0] });
  });

  it('should set the admin correctly', async () => {
    // Ensure that the admin is set to the first account that deployed the contract
    const admin = await lottery.admin();
    assert.equal(admin, accounts[0], 'Admin was not set correctly');
  });

  it('should allow players to invest', async () => {
    // Invest 0.3 ether from the second account
    await lottery.invest({ from: accounts[1], value: web3.utils.toWei('0.3', 'ether') });

    // Ensure that the player was added to the list of players
    const players = await lottery.players();
    assert.equal(players[0], accounts[1], 'Player was not added correctly');

    // Ensure that the balance of the contract was increased by the investment amount
    const balance = await lottery.getBalance();
    assert.equal(balance, web3.utils.toWei('0.3', 'ether'), 'Balance was not updated correctly');
  });

  it('should not allow the admin to invest', async () => {
    // Try to invest 0.3 ether from the admin account
    try {
      await lottery.invest({ from: accounts[0], value: web3.utils.toWei('0.3', 'ether') });
      assert.fail('Investment should have failed');
    } catch (error) {
      assert.include(error.message, 'Admin cannot invest', 'Investment should have failed with "Admin cannot invest" error');
    }
  });

  it('should not allow players to invest less than 0.3 ether', async () => {
    // Try to invest 0.2 ether from the second account
    try {
      await lottery.invest({ from: accounts[1], value: web3.utils.toWei('0.2', 'ether') });
      assert.fail('Investment should have failed');
    } catch (error) {
      assert.include(error.message, 'To join invest 3 ether', 'Investment should have failed with "To join invest 3 ether" error');
    }
  });

  it('should select a winner and reset the players list', async () => {
    // Invest 0.3 ether from three different accounts
    await lottery.invest({ from: accounts[1], value: web3.utils.toWei('0.3', 'ether') });
    await lottery.invest({ from: accounts[2], value: web3.utils.toWei('0.3', 'ether') });
    await lottery.invest({ from: accounts[3], value: web3.utils.toWei('0.3', 'ether') });

    // Call the selectWinner function from the admin account
    await lottery.selectWinner({ from: accounts[0] });

    // Ensure that the winner was selected and received the entire balance of the contract
    const winner = await lottery.players(0);
    const balance = await lottery.getBalance();
    assert.equal(winner, accounts[1] || winner == accounts[2] || winner == accounts[3], 'Winner was not selected correctly');
    assert.equal(balance, 0, 'Balance was not reset correctly');
  });
});


/*
"These tests cover the basic functionality of the Lottery smart contract and test for some common edge cases. 
However, it is important to note that more comprehensive testing is required to ensure the security and reliability of the smart contract. 
It is also recommended to perform manual code reviews and security audits in addition to automated testing."
